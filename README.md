# SE-4486: AI for Games

## Overview
This repository contains the in-class live coding examples from the **SE-4486: AI for Games** course. The code demonstrates various artificial intelligence (AI) methods and their applications in game development, providing students with practical insights into building intelligent behaviors for games. In the implementation of the several topics Slick2D (a simple Java 2D game library) is utilized 

## Topics Covered
The project includes implementations of the following AI techniques and concepts:

### **Game Engine**
- **Simple Game Engine**: A foundational framework to build and test AI algorithms.

### **Movement Algorithms**
- **Seek**
- **Arrive**
- **Flee**
- **Wander**
- **Follow Path**

### **Pathfinding Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **A***

### **Decision-Making Methods**
- **Decision Trees**
- **State Machines**
- **Behavior Trees**

### **Board Game AI**
- **Minimax**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Zobrist Keys**
- **Transposition Tables**


## Code Organization
- The repository is structured by topics, with each topic implemented in separate packages.
- Each package contains examples demonstrating the AI techniques covered in lectures.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
